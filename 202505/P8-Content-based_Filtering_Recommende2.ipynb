To understand how similarity between different products is computed, there are different techniques or similarity measures that are used to compute the similarity, such as Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.\n","\n","\n","This practical helps you to learn how to build a basic model of content-based recommender systems using the Movies Data set that is publicly available on Kaggle. You will learn how to build a system that recommends movies that are similar to a particular movie. To achieve this, you will compute pairwise cosine similarity scores for all movies based on their plot descriptions and recommend movies based on that similarity score threshold.\n","\n","Reference:\n","\n","(full dataset can be downloaded here) https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv\n","\n","(The reference of this practical) https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6Iz70mJ8CQjQ"},"source":["## Section 1 Data Preparation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"To7XPwmuCQjQ"},"source":["\"movies_metadata.csv\" contains information on ~45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset.
